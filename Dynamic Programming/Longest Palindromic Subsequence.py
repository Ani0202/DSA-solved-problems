'''
Given a string A, find the common palindromic sequence ( A sequence which does not need to be contiguous and is a pallindrome), which is common in itself.

You need to return the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.

NOTE:

Your code will be run on multiple test cases (<=10). Try to come up with an optimised solution.


Problem Constraints
 1 <= |A| <= 1005



Input Format
First and only argument is an string A.



Output Format
Return a integer denoting the length of longest palindromic subsequence in A.

class Solution:
    # @param A : string
    # @return an integer
    def solve(self, A):
        n = len(A)
        dp = [[0 for i in range(n)] for j in range(n)]
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i, n):
                if i == j:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                elif A[i] == A[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])

        return dp[0][n-1]
